title: Context Sensitive Help
description: Welcome brave explorer to the Street As context sensitive help page. You most likely navigated to this page by clicking the help icon in Business Central (the one that looks like a question mark) and then clicking a link under the About apps on this page section. If the page you were looking at has a special topic dedicated to that page, you will have been taken straight to that topic heading when you clicked the link. If there is no dedicated help topic for the page you were on, you will have been shown the top of this page and will be reading this text, probably wondering why you are here, and what it was you were trying to do before you arrived.

# Company Information

The company address and ship-to address have changed to allow New Zealand address formats to be entered. See *New Zealand Address Format* for more details.

## General

The **Country/Region Code** field has moved to appear before the first of the address fields in the General tab and all of the address fields have moved to be within a group that will either display **New Zealand Address** if the Country/Region Code matches a country that has a Country Address Format of *New Zealand*, or will display **Address** if the Country Address Format is set to *Other*.

## Shipping

The **Ship-to Country/Region Code** field has moved to appear before the first of the ship-to address fields in the Shipping tab and all of the ship-to address fields have moved to be within a group that will either display **New Zealand Address** if the Ship-to Country/Region Code matches a country that has a Country Address Format of *New Zealand*, or will display **Address** if the Country Address Format is set to *Other*.

# Countries/Regions

The Countries/Regions page has a new **Country Address Format** field that will control how addresses will be displayed on pages that show an address and how the addresses will be formatted on printed reports. Currently only two options are available:

- Other
- New Zealand

With the option set to *Other* the system will behave as it did before Street As was installed. All address-formatting options will be in affect. When the option is set to *New Zealand* the standard address formatting fields such as **Address Format** and **Contact Address Format** will be ignored and the New Zealand address formatting will be used. See *New Zealand Address Format* for more details.

# Customer Card

There are some extra fields on the customer card. Deal with it

It's a nice page isn't it. :-)
