# Company Information

The company address and ship-to address have changed to allow New Zealand address formats to be entered. See *New Zealand Address Format* for more details.

## General

The **Country/Region Code** field has moved to appear before the first of the address fields in the General tab and all of the address fields have moved to be within a group that will either display **New Zealand Address** if the Country/Region Code matches a country that has a Country Address Format of *New Zealand*, or will display **Address** if the Country Address Format is set to *Other*.

## Shipping

The **Ship-to Country/Region Code** field has moved to appear before the first of the ship-to address fields in the Shipping tab and all of the ship-to address fields have moved to be within a group that will either display **New Zealand Address** if the Ship-to Country/Region Code matches a country that has a Country Address Format of *New Zealand*, or will display **Address** if the Country Address Format is set to *Other*.
