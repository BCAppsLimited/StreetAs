# Company Information

The company address and ship-to address have changed to allow New Zealand address formats to be entered. See *New Zealand Address Format* for more details.

## General

The **Country/Region Code** field has moved to appear before the first of the address fields in the General tab and all of the address fields have moved to be within a group that will either display **New Zealand Address** if the Country/Region Code matches a country that has a Country Address Format of *New Zealand*, or will display **Address** if the Country Address Format is set to *Other*.

## Shipping

The **Ship-to Country/Region Code** field has moved to appear before the first of the ship-to address fields in the Shipping tab and all of the ship-to address fields have moved to be within a group that will either display **New Zealand Address** if the Ship-to Country/Region Code matches a country that has a Country Address Format of *New Zealand*, or will display **Address** if the Country Address Format is set to *Other*.

# Countries/Regions

The Countries/Regions page has a new **Country Address Format** field that will control how addresses will be displayed on pages that show an address and how the addresses will be formatted on printed reports. Currently only two options are available:

- Other
- New Zealand

With the option set to *Other* the system will behave as it did before Street As was installed. All address-formatting options will be in affect. When the option is set to *New Zealand* the standard address formatting fields such as **Address Format** and **Contact Address Format** will be ignored and the New Zealand address formatting will be used. See *New Zealand Address Format* for more details.

# Customer Card

There are some extra fields on the customer card. Deal with it

It's a nice page isn't it. :-)
